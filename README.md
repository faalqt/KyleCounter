# KyleCounter
If you're here from my resume, I linked the wrong project and meant to link to [this one instead](https://github.com/faalqt/deadweight)

A website that tracks the usage of State Sized Hints that Kyle uses. 
This was made before I learned about how easy it was to escape from HTML / go back to HTML in a PHP document.

You can see it here (Link could be broken as I have graduated and my Database account will be deleted soon):
